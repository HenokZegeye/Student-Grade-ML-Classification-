# Student-Grade-ML-Classification-
This project contains a Jupyter notebook code and a scientific report for a machine learning problem to classify student Grades.
The Random Forest Algorithm and Support Vector Machine Algorithm are applied and their performance compared and evaluated.
The data was collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning, hosted on the online learning management system Moodle. The goal of this project is to use two different approaches (one a random forest classifier and one and approach of your choice) to predict studentsâ€™ final grade in an online course.
Google Colab is recommended to run the notebook.
